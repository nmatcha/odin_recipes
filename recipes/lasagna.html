    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagne (US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, UK: /ləˈzænjə/, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]; singular lasagna, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]) are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[1] made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.[2]</p>
    <p>The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet - they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
        <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</l>
        <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
